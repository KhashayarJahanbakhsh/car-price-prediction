# üöó Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts used car prices based on technical and categorical features such as year, mileage, engine, max power, fuel type, and more.  
I compared multiple regression models and identified the best-performing one.

## Model Performance
After training multiple models, Random Forest achieved the best performance:

| Model         | RMSE (‚Üì)  | R¬≤ (‚Üë)  | CV RMSE (‚Üì) |
|---------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Random Forest | 137,592   | 0.9711  | 0.223       |
| XGBoost       | 155,900   | 0.9629  | 0.219       |
| Ridge         | 321,616   | 0.8422  | 0.310       |
| ElasticNet    | 407,382   | 0.7468  | 0.327       |
| Lasso         | 453,471   | 0.6863  | 0.354       |

‚úÖ **Conclusion**: Random Forest is the most accurate model for predicting car prices.

## üìä Results Visualization

### R¬≤ Comparison
Higher R¬≤ = more variance explained.  
Random Forest again performed best (R¬≤ ‚âà **0.97**).
In this figure you can see rhe result between Random Foresr and XGBoost very close to each other.
 This bar chart shows the R¬≤ score (coefficient of determination) for each model. R¬≤ values range from 0 to 1, where:

1 indicates perfect prediction
0 means the model is no better than a horizontal line
Negative values indicate worse performance than a horizontal line
Models are sorted from highest to lowest R¬≤ score.

### Model RMSE Comparison
This bar chart compares the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across different models. Lower RMSE values indicate better performance. 
The models are sorted from best (lowest RMSE) to worst. This visualization helps quickly identify which model performs best at minimizing prediction errors.

###Feature_Importance

These horizontal bar charts show which features most influence the model's predictions. For tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost), importance is typically calculated based on:

How much the feature decreases the impurity (Gini importance)
How often the feature is used to split the data
Features are sorted by importance, with the most important features at the top

### SHAP Summary Plot
The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) summary plot provides detailed insights into feature importance and impact:

Each point represents a car in the dataset
The x-axis shows the SHAP value (impact on model output)
The y-axis lists features by importance
Color represents the feature value (red = high, blue = low)
This plot helps understand:

The direction of each feature's effect on price
The magnitude of each feature's impact
How different values of each feature affect the prediction
